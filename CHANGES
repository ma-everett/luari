Changes Between 0.2 and 0.2a:
-----------------------------

Updated for lua 5.2 API from lua 5.1 API, made some minor cleanups here and
there. 

Changes Between 0.1 and 0.2:
----------------------------

Basically the entire code base has been rewritten, due to the decision to
implement the module in C++ rather then in C (which was the case for version 
0.1). This was done to tie in with the rest of the G&RT project. 

The interface has only changed outside of the RI Binding, so this should be
easy to absorb as changes go.
